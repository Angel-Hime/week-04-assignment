    🎯 Confirm that your project is functional on multiple screen sizes using either Responsive Design or media queries.


    🎯 Create a working GET API route in your server.


    🎯 Create a working POST API route in your client.

Stretch Requirements

    🏹 Style the page excellently, for example, by adding extra UX considerations or animations.


    🏹 Add a delete button to each message and a DELETE route in the server.
