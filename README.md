Reflection

    I felt that the logic was all there, I followed the steps provided in the lessons and finding out how it all worked.

    Honestly, this is the only week that I didn't have a full crash-out. The tism still had my sufferring a bit but I really liked that Manny was some intent on emphasising the planning because once I got to thinking about it all and breaking it all down the logic became more clear!

    I did struggle when it came to figuring out which port and route went where.

    I wanted to make it so the submit button was something that would clear the form as well as load the latest user comment below the submission form. I did have suspicions that this would be innerhtml work but it was with Manny's help that I was able to do this as I was not sure as to where I should put the sections where I was rebuilding the form. I struggled with getting the fresh data straight from the server though; I couldn't display the newest post. I just could not figure out how to render the newest post again, so the fact that I figured out how the complete the likes and delete functions kinda felt redundant. Could I please get some help with this?
